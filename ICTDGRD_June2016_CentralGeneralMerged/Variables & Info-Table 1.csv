Variable,Description,,,
Problem 1: Data Not Credible,"Flag to exclude this data from econometric analysis, and generally treat with extreme caution, owing to concerns about the quality of either the revenue data or GDP data",,,
Problem 2: Cannot Exclude Resource Revenue Tax Categories,Flag to exclude this data from econometric analysis owing to conerns that it is not analytically comparable to surrounding data,,,
Problem 3: Data is of Questionable Analytical Comparability,"Flag to exclude this data from econometric analysis, and generally treat with extreme caution, because it has been impossible to exclude resource revenues from tax figures",,,
Problem 4: Cannot Exclude Resource Revenue from Sub-Components of Total Tax Revenue,"Flag to exclude parts of this data from econometric analysis, and generally treat with extreme caution, because it has been impossible to exclude resource revenues from one or more of the sub-components of total tax revenue",,,
"Treat with Caution 1: Un-excluded Resource Revenue are Marginal, but Non-Negligible","Flag to treat this data with caution, as resource revenues are small, but not entirely negligible, and are not excluded from tax revenue because they are not reported separately in existing sources",,,
